# oneButtonGame
For this project, I created a simple shooter game, based on the class cannon example. I was inspired by the idea of magic and witches due to Halloween coming up, as well as the look of an old retro video game. The witch hats are possessed, and you, the player, need to capture them in a bubble using your magic staff. Be careful to not let them escape!
